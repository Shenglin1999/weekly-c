        <h1><span class="Highlight"> Weekliy C</span></h1>
        <div><span class="one"">After this week's study, we have learned more about CSS, how to add borders and create more diverse layouts. How to use different fonts and increase skills such as italics. </div>

            <span class="two">I didn't expect that in our previous assignment, everyone had similar ideas and created a webpage similar to a text interactive game. This made me feel very interesting and a bit disappointed because when I showed it again, I didn't show the many branches I set up and the little humor I left behind. This is also an experience for me, and I think I should make the homepage more stunning next time. </span>
   <br>
   <br>
   <span class="three">This week, I finally found a little time to play TFT for a while. Since I returned to the United States after summer vacation, I have hardly played video games. I feel like life is too rushed and I'm a bit out of breath. Electronic games always give me a brief relaxation in matching. </span>
    <br>
       <span class="four">I've been thinking about going to the shooting range for a while to relax, but I haven't had the opportunity to go. I hope the next two weeks can be relatively relaxed. </span>
    <br>
    <br>
       <span class="five">I still haven't taken an art philosophy course, and my friends who have taken this course say it's very difficult, which makes me a bit scared. After all, I am doing my best to build my GPA. I already have an inexplicable fear of philosophy. Because I have a friend who majors in philosophy. When we first met, I felt like he was very sunny and cheerful, but recently I feel like he's not quite the same as before. I hope he's okay. </span>
